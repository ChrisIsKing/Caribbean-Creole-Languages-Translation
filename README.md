# Caribbean Creole Languages Translation
This repository contains the data and models for the Caribbean Languages Project. The Caribbean region remains largely underdeveloped in the field of computing. The recent emphasis on AI, especially in the field of NLP has further widened this gap both in terms of resources and expertise. We are a team of researchers born and raised in the Caribbean deeply committed to developing the region's technology landscape. We believe that AI can be a
major force in bridging the linguistic and technological divides in the Caribbean region. This collaborative project is focused on developing NLP models for speech and translation for Caribbean Creole languages.
